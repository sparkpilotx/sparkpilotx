# How to Add New Samples

This project uses automatic sample registration. To add a new sample:

## 1. Create Sample Component
Create a new directory under `src/renderer/src/samples/your-sample-name/` with an `index.tsx` file that exports a default React component.

**That's it!** The sample will be automatically registered.

## 2. Configure Sample
Set `VITE_CURRENT_SAMPLE="your-sample-name"` in your `.env` file to activate the new sample.

## How Auto-Registration Works
- [App.tsx](mdc:src/renderer/src/App.tsx) uses `import.meta.glob('./samples/*/index.tsx')` to auto-discover samples
- Directory name becomes the sample key (e.g., `samples/my-sample/` â†’ `VITE_CURRENT_SAMPLE="my-sample"`)
- Manual samples like `workflow` are still supported for samples outside the `samples/` directory

## Current Sample Structure
- **Auto-registered**: All directories in `src/renderer/src/samples/`
- **Manual samples**: `workflow` (from workflow directory)
- **Config**: Environment variable `VITE_CURRENT_SAMPLE` controls which sample loads
- **Example**: [placeholder sample](mdc:src/renderer/src/samples/placeholder/index.tsx)
