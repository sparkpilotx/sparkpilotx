# Guidelines for Creating Cursor Rules

When creating or editing rules for this project, please follow these guidelines to ensure they are effective and concise:

1.  **Prioritize Brevity**: Language models have a fixed context size. Keep rules short and to the point.
2.  **Focus on Project-Specific Context**: Only include information that is specific to this project and that an AI would not know by default.
    *   **Good Example**: "This project uses Electron version `37`."
    *   **Bad Example**: "Electron is a framework for building desktop apps with web technologies." (The AI already knows this).
3.  **Omit General Knowledge**: Do not add explanations for common technologies, libraries, or programming concepts. The AI assistant is already trained on this information.
4.  **Keep it Maintainable**: For package versions, prefer using only the major version number to avoid frequent updates (e.g., `19` instead of `19.1.0`).

The goal is to provide a dense, high-signal context to the AI, not to write a comprehensive project encyclopedia.
